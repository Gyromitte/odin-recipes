    <h2>French Provencal dish of stewed vegetables</h2>
    <p>So good and so easy, this comforting Provencal dish is great warm as a side dish, or cold with cottage cheese for lunch. The leftovers just keep getting better. See footnote for oven and slow-cooker directions.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients: </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (28 ounce) can diced tomatoes, undrained</li>
        <li>2 zucchini, scrubbed and cut into 1/2-inch cubes</li>
        <li>2 yellow squash, scrubbed and cut into 1/2-inch cubes</li>
        <li>1 eggplant, scrubbed and cut into 1/2-inch cubes</li>
        <li>1 onion, finely diced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>Â½ teaspoon Italian seasoning, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 pinch garlic powder, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground black pepper, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps: </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour diced tomatoes into a large saucepan or Dutch oven over medium-low heat; add zucchini, yellow squash, eggplant, and onion; stir once. Sprinkle salt over vegetables. Bring mixture to a boil and simmer until the vegetables start to cook down, 10 to 15 minutes; stir in Italian seasoning, garlic powder, and black pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Cook uncovered over medium-high heat until the sauce has reduced and vegetables are tender, about 1 hour, stirring often. (Or if preferred, cover pan and cook over low heat 2 to 3 hours.) Stir in tomato paste and adjust seasonings. Drizzle with olive oil just before serving.</li>
    </ol>
